This init file is empty because this folder is not a real Python package.

To run any of the module tests, use the command: 

    python -m test.<module_name>

    
For example, to run the test for milestone_1-3.py, use the command:
    
        python -m test.milestone_1-3

        
Make sure you are in the root directory of the project when you run the command.
