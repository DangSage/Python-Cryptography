# Python-Cryptography
This is project aims to eventually build a secure cryptographic version of airdrop as part of a Intro to Computer Security course at UML. Using Python, we will use cryptographic procedures with pycryptodome to achieve the goal of this project.

For Milestones 1-3, run the registration_and_login.py file by running:
  "python registration_and_login.py"

Must have the cryptography library install
  - pip install cryptography
