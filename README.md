# Python-Cryptography
This is project aims to eventually build a secure cryptographic version of airdrop as part of a Intro to Computer Security course at UML. Using Python, we will use cryptographic procedures with pycryptodome to achieve the goal of this project.

This is a demonstration of Task 4, encrypting and decrypting a plaintext. Look at output.txt to see how we got this assortment of files.

Must have the cryptography library install
  - pip install cryptography
