# Secure Airdrop with Cryptography
This project aims to create a secure cryptographic version of an airdrop mechanism using Python. We will employ both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, specifically RSA and AES, to achieve our goal.
  
  For external users, it's important to know the fundamental concepts of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, as this project showcases their practical application in securing data transfers. Knowledge of Python and the PyCryptodome library will be helpful for understanding the implementation details.
  
To run the milestones, run the individual files in the test "package" as modules as such:
  - python -m test.<module_name>

Must have the pycryptodomex library installed to run
  - pip install pycryptodomex
