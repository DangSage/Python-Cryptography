# Python-Cryptography
This is project aims to eventually build a secure cryptographic version of airdrop as part of a Intro to Computer Security course at UML. Using Python, we will use cryptographic procedures with pycryptodomex to achieve the goal of this project.

To run the milestones, run the individual files in the test "package" as modules as such:
  - python -m test.<module_name>

Must have the pycryptodomex library installed to run
  - pip install pycryptodomex
